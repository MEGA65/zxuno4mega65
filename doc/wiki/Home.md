# ZX-Uno @ MEGA65: ZX Spectrum Core
This MEGA65 Core is based on Miguel Angel Rodriguez Jodar's great [ZX-Uno](https://zxuno.speccy.org/index_e.shtml). It was ported to the MEGA65 in 2020/21 by [sy2002](http://sy2002.de). The ZX Spectrum is quite a machine! For sure not self-explanatory for beginners and the core does need a specially prepared SD card, so do not miss the [[Getting Started]] tutorial.

1. Walk through the [[Getting Started]] tutorial: Download the right core and prepare the SD card

2. Learn more about the [[Keyboard Mapping]] 

3. Fine tune your [[Joysticks]]

4. Make sure that the [[Games|Gaming]] that you want to play are running well

### Important keys

* <kbd>Esc</kbd> enters the file manager where you can browse the SD card and load/run programs. Use the cursor keys to navigate,
  <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open a subfolder or run a program and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to go up one sub-folder-level.
* Backspace is not <kbd>Inst/Del</kbd> on the ZX Spectrum but <kbd>Arrow left</kbd> (which is the key to the left of <kbd>1</kbd>).
* When <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> is on, then the cursor keys are emulating a Sinclair (aka Interface 2) joystick, while the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar is the fire button.
